            <h2>The Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Zach Z Zapps has two main purposes. <br>
                The first, to show off my current, upcoming, and past development projects. <br>
                The second, to one day grow into the kind of success where my projects
                 and applications help make someone's life, that much easier.
            </p>

            <h2>The Developer</h2>
            <p>
                I have always had a passion for computer science. I would say I got
                into the game late. I got a general Information Technology Degree online from 
                American Public University. From here, I studied and practice to get a couple 
                CompTIA certificates. All the while, searching for jobs that would let me get
                 into my desired field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward 4 years and 100s of job applications (with barely an interview), 
                I finally have been able to get into the technology field. On top of that, 
                I have started Zach Z. Apps. This is my gateway into development.
                I love the ability to grab a keyboard and create. I have always been artistic, 
                but unable to express that through the normal means. I feel development 
                has been that outlet.
