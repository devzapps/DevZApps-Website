                <h2>DoseR-X is here!</h2>
                <p>
                    Anybody with kids has been through it before. 
                    They get sick and start running a fever. 
                    The only way to keep it down is give them a steady stream of Tylenol or Ibuprofen, 
                    sometimes both, depending on the severity. 
                    You give them a dose. 
                    All is good, until their temp begins to rise again. 
                    You reach for the bottle but slowly realize you forgot what time you gave them that last dose. 
                    Enter DoseR-X.

                <p>
                    DoseR-X makes it easy to track what medication you gave and to who you gave it to. 
                    It makes it easy to track not only what medications have been taken, 
                    but also the medications that need to get taken. 
                    Whether you are tracking a 10-day dose of antibiotics for the kids or 
                    tracking your own prescription for 90 days, 
                    DoseR-X makes it easy. Have 30 days’ worth of blood pressure pills 
                    you need to take? Easy! 
                    Schedule it, and DoseR-X will remind you after the time period you select. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    DoseR-X can log everything you take. 
                    It automatically sorts by date and puts the most recent dose taken on the top of the list. 
                    Would you rather sort by the person, or the name of the medication? DoseR-X has a button to easily, 
                    and quickly sort by these different options. 
                    You can log a medication taken quickly from the scheduled tab, 
                    or manually under the log tab if you do not need the dose scheduled.
