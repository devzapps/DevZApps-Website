                    Letter Practice is an app developed for parents to work with 
                    their children that are learning their letters and numbers. 
                    Letter Practice lets you choose between capital letters, lower-case letters, 
                    and numbers currently up to 20. 
                    Letter Practice will shuffle through a category with the press of a button 
                    while randomly presenting in a new color and playing a different sound with each press.

                <h2>App number 1 is here!</h2>
                <p>
                    As I have stated before, most of my app ideas come from problems 
                    that I need solutions to and this is no exception. 
                    Even before my daughter entered school, she had to get involved in the 
                    tough world of learning not only her letters, 
                    but her numbers as well. 
                    While in Preschool, she learned her capital letters with ease. 
                    She caught on pretty early and had no real issues. 
                    Then came the hard partâ€¦lowercase letters. 
                    Eventually, she had to dabble in numbers. 
                    One to ten, easy. Eleven and on, not so easy. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed this app to make it easy to play with her and 
                    help her see and recognize her various letters and numbers. 
                    Letter Practice has 3 main categories. 
                    Capital letters, lowercase letters, and numbers ranging from one to 20. 
                    With the tap of a single button, Letter Practice will shuffle within the 
                    category selected and present a letter or number from that category 
                    while playing a fun sound and changing to a random color of the 
                    rainbow to help keep the kiddos engaged. 
                    Presenting a greater challenge, 
                    you can also shuffle between all categories at once. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This has been a huge success in my house and now I extend it to you, for free. 
                    Have fun with this app and enjoy playing with, and watching your child grow 
                    and learn in an easy, and fun environment.
