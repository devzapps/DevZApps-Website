                <h2>Here comes another app!</h2>
                <p>
                    Today I am releasing my second app 
                    called "Your Pro Flash Cards"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea for a flash cards app came from watching my wife struggle 
                    with flash cards while in college. 
                    Certain classes, notecards were her best friend when it came to 
                    learning certain terms or subjects, as many can attest too. 
                    That didn't mean they were convenient or easy to use. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your Pro Flash Cards was derived from watching the little struggles 
                    she had to put up with using notecards. 
                    She would constantly have piles of cards from different decks, 
                    she would have to manually shuffle and mix them up (which costs precious time), 
                    and when the time came she would have to find them. 
                    I have yet to mention the kids running around that would constantly get into them, 
                    mixing decks up, ripping up cards, coloring over all her hard work, 
                    or just plain losing them altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my app, everything can be kept together in one place, easily manageable and organized. 
                    What would normally be hand written on hundreds of cards, 
                    can now be in one spot, on your phone, that you can take anywhere to 
                    add, edit, or review whenever free time allows.
                </p>
                <p>
