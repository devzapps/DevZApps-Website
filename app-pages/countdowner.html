                    Count-Downer is an easy-to-use and personal app for counting down the days to that next special event. 
                    Don't ever miss the next birthday, anniversary, or Holiday ever again with daily reminders for any dates you choose.

                <h2>It's the final countdown!</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have ever forgot a birthday or had to wonder how your anniversary 
                    could sneak up on you so easily, 
                    then Count-Downer is a must have for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I cannot remember my own birthday to save my life. 
                    This app will not only help with that, but any date you deem meaningful enough to countdown too. 
                    How many days until your anniversary? How about the number of days until you graduate? 
                    Count-Downer makes it easy to track all of these days at once!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Count-Downer lets you easily setup and personalize events that show an always up-to-date countdown, 
                    down to the second. You can schedule a daily reminder to tell you daily, the number of days left for each event you specify. 
                    Have a past event you want to track but, don't want to see it every time you open the app? Easily archive old events, 
                    even automatically if you wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Count-Downer is customizable to your needs and you can make it your own just by adding your first event!
                </p>
